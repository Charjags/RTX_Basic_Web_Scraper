# RTX_Basic_Web_Scraper
Python tool allowing for an easier way to find RTX graphic cards which are regularly sold out. As of right now, it scans Best Buy, Newegg, and Reddit for graphic cards in stock. Stay tuned as I update this program regularly to increase its outreach! It finds the type of graphic card, price, and link to buy for every available option! and gives you an option to search as many times as you want!
